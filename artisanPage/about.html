                <h1>June 2019</h1>
                <p>I had just gotten out of the military and no purpose in life.
                   I was lost and trying to figure out what to do.

                <h1>June 2021</h1>
                <p>I had stumbled upon pottery, but since I was focusing in pottery on free time outside of work my boss decided 
                    to let me go from work because I was "not all in for his company" he did not like I had a hobby
                </p>

            <div id="story-container">
                <h1>June 2023</h1>
                <p>I started going all in this company. Thank to you guys this small business has been taking off.
                   I enjoy working with my hands everyday and creating something new from nothing.

                <h1>Present</h1>
                <p>Demand has sky rocketed. Thanks to that I have my wife helping me with the business. Also I created this website
                   This way I can keep in touch with everyone.
